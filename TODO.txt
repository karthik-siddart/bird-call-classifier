TODO

make spectrogram of good sound 
    make second spectrogram same species
    align them if possible
    run through keras tenserflow sequential

get spectrogram with:
    -get pyAudio working in 3 
    -using pyAudioAnalysis get a baseline with the latent fetures it provides
    or
    -yaafe

-find master list of songs from git
    seperate data into buckets by species (I failed to do that when It would have been easier)
-preprocess audio with filters for species high-pass for tweety birds / low pass for owls

blockers: (potential) may have to change mp3 to wav -- time or subset selection

extra:
read Jake's cnn refered document
video safari tensor flow 

-----------Thursday--------------------
Chockablocked EC2 and recovered
pain to recover but no data loss
ec2 to s3 not as fast as I would like

Finished scraping : 31,7621 files
                    76 G mp3 files all labeled data
                    all files in s3 bucket and on laptop currently
pyAudioAnalysis fixed a bit for python3 -- not well documented or I need to read it and follow links
reviewed ML architecture of using Keras and TensorFlow
----------------------------------
-----------Wed--------------------
DONE made list for western americas but harder to scrape so leaving til later
----------------------------------
-----------Tues--------------------
DONE add reference papers and sites
DONE data sites
DONE make repos public and send out
