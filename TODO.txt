TODO

today: make metric artifacts from data collected during runs
--look for false pos / false neg and tp and tn -- get spectrograms and sound file
use model.predict to predict one -- will need to use labels


--- wed and big weekend ---



-day: got baseline cnn operating 
40% on 1000ish 5 catogories subset
Thursday: Turkey and adjusted params and used log power spectrogram added cnn layer: 71% after 50 epochs on subset (but I need to look at tensorflow to see if that was too many or not enough.


Today: examine last nights run, move to cloud and run on “full” dataset (I intend to balance it out so not full dataset)
And adjust features again and see if I can improve on acc. I used a 70/30 split rerandomized for each run and only stated validation acc.consider doing transformable

make spectrogram of good sound 
    make second spectrogram same species
    align them if possible
    run through keras tenserflow sequential

get spectrogram with:
    -get pyAudio working in 3 
    -using pyAudioAnalysis get a baseline with the latent fetures it provides
    or
    -yaafe

-----------weekend--------------------
no data loss --- data dups 4k files deleted now all match
investigated librosa
installed librosa

designed flow:
stack:
    preprocess:
        aubio
        yaafe
        librosa
        feature extraction
        alignment of sound start -- remove talk lead in if exists

        export image

tensorflow keras 
----------------------------------
-----------Friday--------------------

installed ffmpeg, ffprobe, etc libraries
investigated and installed lib yaafe c++ support libs--bit involved
----------------------------------

-----------Thursday--------------------
Chockablocked EC2 and recovered
pain to recover but no data loss
ec2 to s3 not as fast as I would like

Finished scraping : 31,7621 files
                    76 G mp3 files all labeled data
                    all files in s3 bucket and on laptop currently
pyAudioAnalysis fixed a bit for python3 -- not well documented or I need to read it and follow links
reviewed ML architecture of using Keras and TensorFlow
----------------------------------
-----------Wed--------------------
DONE made list for western americas but harder to scrape so leaving til later
----------------------------------
-----------Tues--------------------
DONE add reference papers and sites
DONE data sites
DONE make repos public and send out
----------------------------------

Today - Thanksgivign:
    write program to take the 1038 list and subdirs for generator and read them in from main pool dir of sound files
    add changes to sound input 
    write to tree for generator reading
    use base model to see if difference 
        change model and see if difference
    repeat until happy

    --start aws ec2 with attached block storage for 100G

    change program to read input from s3 bucket
    process all inputs and create generator output directory structure
        do a proper split???
        make sure shuffle is on
        limit to keep balance?

    train model on all data
    see accuracy / f1 etc metrics
    produce metrics based on link taryn provided

===========================================
handpick 5(was 10) songs from 3 species about 30 seconds or so long
--use ones that sounded good to me (get the xc "grade" for the track and only use grade-A)
only use tracks start size of around 700-1000K

decide on features to use
  First run features:
    1. ss
    2. sp
    3. dkdk
    4. dkdk

find start of bird song/call
get 30 seconds if possible

create picture of size a x b color best probably

run it through the cnn and see what I get

put into labeled dir? or extract label?

-----
find duplicate mp3s
  remove duplicate mp3s
straightened out github repo
update git
